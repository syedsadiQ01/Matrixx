                <h3>Description</h3>
              <p><b>The Problem</b><br>

                Data scientist is one of the best suited professions to thrive this century. It is digital, programming-oriented, and analytical. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the demand for data scientists has been surging in the job marketplace.     
                
                However, supply has been very limited. It is difficult to acquire the skills necessary to be hired as a data scientist.    
                
                And how can you do that?  
                
                Universities have been slow at creating specialized data science programs. (not to mention that the ones that exist are very expensive and time consuming)   
                
                Most online courses focus on a specific topic and it is difficult to understand how the skill they teach fit in the complete picture  </p>
                <p>
                    <b>The Solution</b><br>
                    Data science is a multidisciplinary field. It encompasses a wide range of topics.   <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Understanding of the data science field and the type of analysis carried out</li>
                        <li>Mathematics  </li>
                        <li>StatisticsPython</li>
                        <li>Python</li>
                        <li>Applying advanced statistical techniques in Python</li>
                        <li>Data Visualization</li>
                        <li>Machine Learning </li>
                        <li>Deep Learning</li><br>
                    </ul>
                    Each of these topics builds on the previous ones. And you risk getting lost along the way if you don’t acquire these skills in the right order. For example, one would struggle in the application of Machine Learning techniques before understanding the underlying Mathematics. Or, it can be overwhelming to study regression analysis in Python before knowing what a regression is. 
                    <br><b>So, in an effort to create the most effective, time-efficient, and structured data science training available online, we created The Data Science Course 2023.   </b>

                <ol type="1">
                    <li><b> Intro to Data and Data Science</b><p>Big data, business intelligence, business analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence. We know these buzzwords belong to the field of data science but what do they all mean?     </p></li>
                    <li><b>Mathematics</b><p>Learning the tools is the first step to doing data science. You must first see the big picture to then examine the parts in detail.   

                        We take a detailed look specifically at calculus and linear algebra as they are the subfields data science relies on.   </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b> Statistics</b><p>You need to think like a scientist before you can become a scientist. Statistics trains your mind to frame problems as hypotheses and gives you techniques to test these hypotheses, just like a scientist.  

                        <b>Why learn it?  </b>
                        
                        This course doesn’t just give you the tools you need but teaches you how to use them. Statistics trains you to think like a scientist.</p></li>
                    <li><b>Python</b><p>Python is a relatively new programming language and, unlike R, it is a general-purpose programming language. You can do anything with it! Web applications, computer games and data science are among many of its capabilities. That’s why, in a short space of time, it has managed to disrupt many disciplines. Extremely powerful libraries have been developed to enable data manipulation, transformation, and visualisation. Where Python really shines however, is when it deals with machine and deep learning.</p></li>
                    <li><b> Tableau</b><p>Data scientists don’t just need to deal with data and solve data driven problems. They also need to convince company executives of the right decisions to make. These executives may not be well versed in data science, so the data scientist must but be able to present and visualise the data’s story in a way they will understand. That’s where Tableau comes in – and we will help you become an expert story teller using the leading visualisation software in business intelligence and data science.</p></li>
                    <li><b> Advanced Statistics </b><p>Regressions, clustering, and factor analysis are all disciplines that were invented before machine learning. However, now these statistical methods are all performed through machine learning to provide predictions with unparalleled accuracy. This section will look at these techniques in detail.</p></li>
                    <li><b>Machine Learning </b><p>The final part of the program and what every section has been leading up to is deep learning. Being able to employ machine and deep learning in their work is what often separates a data scientist from a data analyst. This section covers all common machine learning techniques and deep learning methods with TensorFlow.  </p></li>
